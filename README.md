# documentation
Here I am attempting a documentation on the project that I analysed, called, AirportCheapestPath.
Link: https://github.com/denizturkk/AirportCheapestPath

Introduction:
The Airport Cheapest Path project is designed to find the cheapest path between airports. This can be useful for travelers looking to minimize their travel costs or for logistics companies planning cost-effective routes. The project is implemented in C and employs algorithms to determine the cheapest path based on given data.

Functionalities:
1. List All Airports: Display all airports in the network.
2. Direct Flights from an Airport: Show all direct flights from a specified airport.
3. All Direct Flights: List all direct flights in the network.
4. Minimum-Cost Path: Show the total cost, each flight's info, costs, and transfer details from source to destination.
5. Minimum-Cost Flights to All Airports: Display minimum-cost flights from a source airport to all other airports.
    5.1 Path Details for Listed Flights: Show total cost, each flight's info, costs, and transfer details for selected paths.
